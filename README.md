 * [About](#About)

    I'm developing this project for a hands-on study of React.  The project is still under construction, but it basically consists of an application where you can organize your tasks, whether they are day-to-day tasks or just to better monitor your tasks at work.  
    You will also have the option to edit a calendar, putting descriptions and the time of each task that takes to complete, helping you to optimize your deadlines and submits.
